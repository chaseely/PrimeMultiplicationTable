# PrimeNumberChallenge

## Objective
Write a program that prints out a multiplication table of the first 10 primary numbers. 

The program must run from the command line and print one table to STDOUT. The first row 
and column of the table should have the 10 primes, with each cell containing the product
of the primes for the corresponding row and column.

## What it does
This program generates a multiplication table for a given number of prime numbers. If a
number is not given it will generate a multiplication table for the first 10 prime numbers.

## How to run
From the command line run:
`python prime_multiplication_table.py <number of primes>`

Running `python prime_multiplication_table.py` without arguments defaults to using 10 prime numbers.

## Dependencies
Python >= 3.5
